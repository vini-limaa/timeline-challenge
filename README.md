## Notes

1. **What did I like about my implementation?**

   - All requirements were met
   - I implemented a zoom function

1. **What would I change if I were to do it all over again.**

   - I would use a store like Jotai, Redux or React Context API to avoid prop dealing
   - I would develop a drag and drop feature
   - I would use TypeScript to type my functions
   - I would use a date library like INTL
   - I would add more colors, a calendar background and grids

1. **How did I make the design decisions?**

   - I used this design from dribble as a reference: https://dribbble.com/shots/25305515-HR-Management-Absences-Calendar

1. **How would I test this if I had more time?**

   - I would use Jest and React Testing Library to build unit tests
